# DragAndDropForInteractiveExams

This is a test code of a Drag and Drop system for online exams.

This particular code focuses on adding a new interactive question
using a drag and drop system to place elements, like text labels
or small images, into a background image.
After placing an element you get as a result its x,y coordinates.
This coordinates are to be used to when rebuilding the interactive
question in the "Take Exam" part of the system.
